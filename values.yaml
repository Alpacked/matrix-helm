    # When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
    #
    # Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
    # Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
    # will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
    #
    # This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
    # is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
    #
    # 'trustedKeyServers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
    # warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set

    #       one of the given keys.
    #
    #    acceptKeysInsecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
    #       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
    #       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
    #       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing

    #       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this

  # If deploying Coturn with this chart, include the public IPs of each node in your cluster (or a DNS round-robin hostname)
  # You can also include an external Coturn instance if you'd prefer

  # -- How to deploy Coturn
  kind: DaemonSet
  # Options:
  #   DaemonSet:  A DaemonSet will be used to schedule one Coturn pod per node. Each Coturn pod will open the ports it needs directly on the host it is scheduled on.
  #               This maximizes compatibility and will allow you to set up Coturn without any additional cluster configuration.
  #   Deployment: A Deployment will be used to schedule Coturn pods. The number of Coturn pods will be configurable (via the replicaCount setting below).
  #               You will need to use a NodePort service or an external load balancer to route traffic to the Coturn pods.
  #               This is more flexible and can use fewer pods in a multi-node setup, but will require additional networking configuration.

    #              will be configured as the DaemonSet will handle binding to each Node's host networking
    #   NodePort:  Recommended for Deployment configurations. This will open TURN ports on every node and route traffic on these ports to the Coturn pods.
    #              You will need to make sure your cloud provider supports the cluster config setting "apiserver.service-node-port-range", as this range must contain
    #              the ports defined above for the service to be created.
